# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple single-page Twitter clone. It was created as a project for Lighthouse Labs. This app uses jQuery, AJAX, HTML5, CSS3, and express. A user can post tweets that generate random user names and handles. The tweet will show up on the top of the page showing how much time has passed since the tweet was made. Tweets are stored on mongoDB. A character counter is shown which counts down from 140 while the user is typing. 

Error messaging shows up when text field is blank or there are too many characters.

CSS built with responsive design in mind.
